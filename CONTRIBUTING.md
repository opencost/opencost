## Getting Help

If you have a question about OpenCost or have encountered problems using it,
you can start by asking a question on [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/) in the [#opencost](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C03D56FPD4G) channel or via email at [opencost@kubecost.com](opencost@kubecost.com)

## Workflow

This repository's contribution workflow follows a typical open-source model:

- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository
- Work on the forked repository
- Open a pull request to [merge the fork back into this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

## Building OpenCost

Follow these steps to build the OpenCost cost-model and UI from source and
deploy. The provided build tooling is natively multi-architecture (built images
will run on both AMD64 and ARM64 clusters).

Dependencies:
1. Docker (with `buildx`)
2. [just](https://github.com/casey/just) (if you don't want to install Just, read the `justfile` and run the commands manually)
3. Multi-arch `buildx` builders set up via https://github.com/tonistiigi/binfmt
4. `npm` (if you want to build the UI)

### Build the backend

1. `just build "<repo>/opencost:<tag>"`
2. Edit the [pulled image](https://github.com/opencost/opencost/blob/develop/kubernetes/opencost.yaml#L145) in the `kubernetes/opencost.yaml` to `<repo>/opencost:<tag>`
3. Set [this environment variable](https://github.com/opencost/opencost/blob/develop/kubernetes/opencost.yaml#L155) to the address of your Prometheus server

### Build the frontend
1. `cd ui && just build-ui "<repo>/opencost-ui:<tag>"`
2. Edit the [pulled image](https://github.com/opencost/opencost/blob/develop/kubernetes/opencost.yaml#L162) in the `kubernetes/opencost.yaml` to `<repo>/opencost-ui:<tag>`

### Deploy to a cluster

1. `kubectl create namespace opencost`
2. `kubectl apply -f kubernetes/opencost --namespace opencost`
3. `kubectl -n opencost port-forward service/opencost 9090 9003`

To test, build the OpenCost containers and then push them to a Kubernetes cluster with a running Prometheus.

To confirm that the server and UI are running, you can hit [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) to access the OpenCost UI.
You can test the server API with `curl http://localhost:9003/allocation/compute -d window=60m -G`.

## Running locally

To run locally cd into `cmd/costmodel` and `go run main.go`

OpenCost requires a connection to Prometheus in order to operate so setting the environment variable `PROMETHEUS_SERVER_ENDPOINT` is required.
In order to expose Prometheus to OpenCost it may be required to port-forward using kubectl to your Prometheus endpoint.

For example:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-server 9080:80
```

This would expose Prometheus on port 9080 and allow setting the environment variable as so:

```bash
PROMETHEUS_SERVER_ENDPOINT="http://127.0.0.1:9080"
```

If you want to run with a specific kubeconfig the environment variable `KUBECONFIG` can be used. OpenCost will attempt to connect to your Kubernetes cluster in a similar fashion as kubectl so the env is not required. The order of precedence is `KUBECONFIG` > default kubeconfig file location ($HOME/.kube/config) > in cluster config

Example:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
```

An example of the full command:

```bash
ETL_PATH_PREFIX="/my/cool/path/kubecost/var/config" CONFIG_PATH="/my/cool/path/kubecost/var/config" PROMETHEUS_SERVER_ENDPOINT="http://127.0.0.1:9090" go run main.go
```

## Running the integration tests

To run these tests:

- Make sure you have a kubeconfig that can point to your cluster, and have permissions to create/modify a namespace called "test"
- Connect to your the Prometheus OpenCost emits to on localhost:9003:
  `kubectl port-forward --namespace opencost service/prometheus-server 9003:80`
- Temporary workaround: Copy the default.json file in this project at cloud/default.json to /models/default.json on the machine your test is running on. TODO: fix this and inject the cloud/default.json path into provider.go.
- Navigate to cost-model/test
- Run `go test -timeout 700s` from the testing directory. The tests right now take about 10 minutes (600s) to run because they bring up and down pods and wait for Prometheus to scrape data about them.

## Committing

Please write a commit message with Fixes Issue # if there is an outstanding issue that is fixed. It’s okay to submit a PR without a corresponding issue; just please try to be detailed in the description of the problem you’re addressing.

Please run `go fmt` on the project directory. Lint can be okay (for example, comments on exported functions are nice but not required on the server).
