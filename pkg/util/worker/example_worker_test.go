	// say we had 100 inputs, we may not want to create that many go routines, so
	// instead, we can create a pool of goroutines that work on our inputs as fast as
	// possible.

	// Create a worker pool using 50 goroutines:

		// is 50:
		if i == 50 {
			receive := make(chan float64)
			workerPool.Run(i, receive)

	// of workers

	// Shutdown the worker pool when complete
	defer workerPool.Shutdown()

	// number of inputs (let's choose 12 this time), we can pass that to the group as well.
	const numInputs = 12
	orderedGroup := worker.NewOrderedGroup(workerPool, numInputs)

	// loop over our inputs and pass them to the group
	for i := 0; i < numInputs; i++ {

		// error if the number of inputs pushed exceeds that size constraint
		err := orderedGroup.Push(i)
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}

	// Received Result: 10.00 for Input: 0
	// Received Result: 11.00 for Input: 1

func Example_concurrentOrderedSimple() {
	// This last example highlights a simplified version of the previous example. While
	// the ordered example provides tuning knobs for total goroutines and allows pushing
	// data dynamically, it can be quite verbose and difficult to read at times. The worker
	// package also provides a utility function that simplifies the ordered concurrent
	// processing into a worker function and a slice of inputs

	// Let's create our inputs 0-12 like in the previous example
	const numInputs = 12
	inputs := make([]int, numInputs)
